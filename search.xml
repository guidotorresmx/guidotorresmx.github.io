Because I’m <del>not a soulless being</del> used to <strong>VSCODE</strong>, I’ll just set a new workspace in there. So first step is getting to the extensions page within VSCODE and look up for “Github Copilot Extension”.</p><p><img src="/2021/11/10/github-copilot/copilot-extension.png" alt="copilot extension"></p><h3 id="Signing-in"><a href="#Signing-in" class="headerlink" title="Signing in"></a>Signing in</h3><p>The extension will show a pop up in the bottom right side of your VSCODE window, where you’ll have to sign in with github, just click accept to everything that could come up after that and you’ll be okay.</p><p><img src="/2021/11/10/github-copilot/sign-in.png" alt="sign-in pop up"><br><img src="/2021/11/10/github-copilot/authorization.png" alt="authorization"></p><h3 id="First-usage"><a href="#First-usage" class="headerlink" title="First usage"></a>First usage</h3><p>The only thing left for you to do is to create a testing file. I’ll go by creating a <code>test.js</code> file and then start typing a function prototype, if everything works, a drop down suggestions attachment is going to show, there you’ll have to press <code>tab</code> to accept the suggestion.</p><p><img src="/2021/11/10/github-copilot/first-suggestion.png" alt="firs suggestion"><br><img src="/2021/11/10/github-copilot/accept-suggestion.png" alt="accept suggestion"></p><h3 id="Alternatives"><a href="#Alternatives" class="headerlink" title="Alternatives"></a>Alternatives</h3><p>If the first suggestion doesn’t fit your needs, you can press <code>Alt + ]</code> or <code>Alt + [</code> to navigate trough some more options or you can press <code>Ctrl + Enter</code> to open up a new panel where you can inspect all suggestions at once. You can Also add comments before your function declaration and copilot will take that into consideration in order to provide more accurate results</p><h3 id="Beyond-JS"><a href="#Beyond-JS" class="headerlink" title="Beyond JS"></a>Beyond JS</h3><p>Even tho copilot could be a great tool, it could not help anybody if the supported languages are limited to the top 3 most used languages <del>aka JS, Python and Matlab, amerite?</del>. So I tried to get a curated list of the supported file extensions for this preview stage and I could not find anything <del>Even tho I googled it once, seriously?</del> so I’ll dig deeper in a future article, but for the sake of demonstration, I created a bash file and OMG it actually worked.</p><p><img src="/2021/11/10/github-copilot/bash-file.png" alt="bash file"></p><h2 id="Wrapping-Up"><a href="#Wrapping-Up" class="headerlink" title="Wrapping Up"></a>Wrapping Up</h2><p>So copilot is actually working, but I’ll have to test it extensively before throwing up my opinion about its usability and possibilities. but I want to add that some people are quite worried because of this type of tool and the possibility of <del>everybody getting fired</del> reducing the amount of hours a programmer can actually work, but the thing is that the programmers daytime is not actually 100% programming, it is in fact mostly reading, debugging, setting up tools, coming up with ideas, communicate them; so for the time being I wouldn’t be worried because of this, specially because there are a hell lot more of important problems out there to worry about, such as: global warming, war, hunger and the sharknado’s saga. bye!</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="Intro"><a href="#Intro" class="headerlink" title="Intro"></a>Intro</h1><p>Once your awesome Hexo static website is up and running, you may want to deploy it so everybody on the internet can actually read it. fortunately, there are multiple choices, but being myself a humble AWS <del>brainwashed</del> enthusiast, I’m going to introduce you to the github + github actions + route53 + s3 + CloudFront.</p><p>Note: Ignore the fact that github is now another service property of <del>the devil himself in the shape of a corporation</del> Microsoft and just follow me on this one, because publishing your website using github will bring you up some useful features.</p><h1 id="AWS-setup"><a href="#AWS-setup" class="headerlink" title="AWS setup"></a>AWS setup</h1><p>First things first, you have to go to <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/" title="aws console">AWS console webapp</a> and create your AWS account, and set up a specific user for this task; you must not use your root account!</p><h2 id="Step-1-Create-a-new-user"><a href="#Step-1-Create-a-new-user" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Create a new user"></a>Step 1: Create a new user</h2><p>Once you’d created your AWS account, go on and sign in, you will see a nice interface, with a top search omnibar. proceed and type IAM.</p><p><img src="/2021/11/07/deploying-with-github-actions/iam.png" alt="AWS search bar and IAM"></p><p>Then go to <strong>users</strong> on the left panel under <strong>access management</strong> and click on <strong>add Users</strong>; you just have to add a username, and a password policy.</p><p><img src="/2021/11/07/deploying-with-github-actions/iam-user-setup.png" alt="AWS new user and password policy"></p><h2 id="Step-2-Attach-necessary-policies"><a href="#Step-2-Attach-necessary-policies" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Attach necessary policies"></a>Step 2: Attach necessary policies</h2><p>After clicking next, you will have to add attach the actual policies for your new user, type the services you need and check each one of them in the contiguous box. For the purpose of this walkthrough, the needed policies are the following (you will actually need a subset of this credentials, but that out of the scope for this post):</p><ul><li>CLoudFrontFullAccess</li><li>Route53FullAccess</li><li>S3FullAccess</li><li><del>SendBitcoinWalletToGuidoTorresMXFullAccess</del></li></ul><p> <img src="/2021/11/07/deploying-with-github-actions/iam-policies.png" alt="AWS new users policies"></p><h2 id="Step-3-Manage-credentials"><a href="#Step-3-Manage-credentials" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Manage credentials"></a>Step 3: Manage credentials</h2><p>Once the new user is created, you will have full access to your generated credentials, so secure them before you lost them because you’re never going to see them again (specially if you generated the optional console access keys) and try login in with the secure link shown in the screen.</p><p><img src="/2021/11/07/deploying-with-github-actions/iam-user-credentials.png" alt="AWS new user generated credentials"></p><h2 id="Step-4-Create-S3-bucket"><a href="#Step-4-Create-S3-bucket" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Create S3 bucket"></a>Step 4: Create S3 bucket</h2><p>The next step is quite easy, just navigate to S3 by search for it in the omnibar of the AWS Console and click on <strong>Create bucket</strong>. In the next screen choose a decent temporary name for your blog, such as s3-bucket-test (you will certainly not be able to choose that one because your bucket have to have a unique name across all AWS S3 containers online)</p><p><img src="/2021/11/07/deploying-with-github-actions/bucket.png" alt="AWS S3 Bucket creation"><br><img src="/2021/11/07/deploying-with-github-actions/bucket-options.png" alt="AWS S3 Bucket options"></p><h2 id="Step-5-Buckets-and-S3-static-website-hosting"><a href="#Step-5-Buckets-and-S3-static-website-hosting" class="headerlink" title="Step 5: Buckets and S3 static website hosting"></a>Step 5: Buckets and S3 static website hosting</h2><p>After creating the bucket, select it and go to <strong>properties</strong>, the navigate to the bottom of the site until the <strong>static website hosting</strong> section shows up. Edit it and update the fields with the same info showed in the next image:</p><p><img src="/2021/11/07/deploying-with-github-actions/bucket-template.png" alt="AWS S3 Bucket template"></p><h2 id="Step-6-Bucket-vs-public-access"><a href="#Step-6-Bucket-vs-public-access" class="headerlink" title="Step 6: Bucket vs public access"></a>Step 6: Bucket vs public access</h2><p>Once the bucket is set, you have to make it available for the outside world, so you have to specify the policies attached to it: go to permissions tab in your bucket and select edit under bucket policy, then copy the next policy in it (protip: replace <bucket-name> with your bucket’s name).</bucket-name></p><pre><code class="json">{    "Version": "2012-10-17",    "Statement": [        {            "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",            "Effect": "Allow",            "Principal": "*",            "Action": [                "s3:GetObject"            ],            "Resource": [                "arn:aws:s3:::&lt;bucket-name&gt;/*"            ]        }    ]}</code></pre><h1 id="Wrapping-up"><a href="#Wrapping-up" class="headerlink" title="Wrapping up"></a>Wrapping up</h1><p>Once everything is done, you could upload a simple index.html file to your bucket and view it rendered when visiting the site of your bucket. This is nice, but we are far from done and <del>I’m falling asleep</del> I don’t want you to get you overwhelmed, so this walkthrough will become a series of 4 parts 🤷‍♂️💁.   </p>]]></content>

      <title>Asset Folders</title>
      <link href="/2021/11/02/asset-folders/"/>
      <url>/2021/11/02/asset-folders/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Global-Asset-Folder"><a href="#Global-Asset-Folder" class="headerlink" title="Global Asset Folder"></a>Global Asset Folder</h2><p>Assets are non-post files in the <code>source</code> folder, such as images, CSS or JavaScript files. For instance, If you are only going to have a few images in the Hexo project, then the easiest way is to keep them in a <code>source/images</code> directory. Then, you can access them using something like <code>![](/images/image.jpg)</code>.</p><h2 id="Post-Asset-Folder"><a href="#Post-Asset-Folder" class="headerlink" title="Post Asset Folder"></a>Post Asset Folder</h2><div class="video-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/feIDVQ2tz0o" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>For users who expect to regularly serve images and/or other assets, and for those who prefer to separate their assets on a post-per-post basis, Hexo also provides a more organized way to manage assets. This slightly more involved, but very convenient approach to asset management can be turned on by setting the <code>post_asset_folder</code> setting in <code>_config.yml</code> to true.</p><pre><code class="yaml">post_asset_folder: true</code></pre><p>With asset folder management enabled, Hexo will create a folder every time you make a new post with the <code>hexo new [layout] &lt;title&gt;</code> command. This asset folder will have the same name as the markdown file associated with the post. Place all assets related to your post into the associated folder, and you will be able to reference them using a relative path, making for an easier and more convenient workflow.</p><h2 id="Tag-Plugins-For-Relative-Path-Referencing"><a href="#Tag-Plugins-For-Relative-Path-Referencing" class="headerlink" title="Tag Plugins For Relative Path Referencing"></a>Tag Plugins For Relative Path Referencing</h2><p>Referencing images or other assets using normal markdown syntax and relative paths may lead to incorrect display on archive or index pages. Plugins have been created by the community to address this issue in Hexo 2. However, with the release of Hexo 3, several new <a href="/docs/tag-plugins#Include-Assets">tag plugins</a> were added to core. These enable you to reference your assets more easily in posts:</p><pre><code>{% asset_path slug %}{% asset_img slug [title] %}{% asset_link slug [title] %}</code></pre><p>For example, with post asset folders enabled, if you place an image <code>example.jpg</code> into your asset folder, it will <em>not</em> appear on the index page if you reference it using a relative path with regular <code>![](example.jpg)</code> markdown syntax (however, it will work as expected in the post itself).</p><p>The correct way to reference the image will thus be using tag plugin syntax rather than markdown:</p><pre><code>{% asset_img example.jpg This is an example image %}{% asset_img "spaced asset.jpg" "spaced title" %}</code></pre><p>This way, the image will appear both inside the post and on index and archive pages.</p><h2 id="Embedding-an-image-using-markdown"><a href="#Embedding-an-image-using-markdown" class="headerlink" title="Embedding an image using markdown"></a>Embedding an image using markdown</h2><p><a href="https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-renderer-marked">hexo-renderer-marked</a> 3.1.0 introduced a new option that allows you to embed an image in markdown without using <code>asset_img</code> tag plugin.</p><p>To enable:</p><pre><code class="yml">post_asset_folder: truemarked:  prependRoot: true  postAsset: true</code></pre><p>Once enabled, an asset image will be automatically resolved to its corresponding post’s path. For example, “image.jpg” is located at “/2020/01/02/foo/image.jpg”, meaning it is an asset image of “/2020/01/02/foo/“ post, <code>![](image.jpg)</code> will be rendered as <code>&lt;img src="/2020/01/02/foo/image.jpg"&gt;</code>.</p>]]></content>

Note that <strong>no spaces are allowed in the list</strong>.</p><p>For instance, in the above example if <code>foo: bar</code> is in <code>custom.yml</code>, but <code>"foo": "dinosaur"</code> is in <code>custom2.json</code>, <code>_multiconfig.yml</code> will contain <code>foo: dinosaur</code>.</p><h3 id="Alternate-Theme-Config"><a href="#Alternate-Theme-Config" class="headerlink" title="Alternate Theme Config"></a>Alternate Theme Config</h3><p>Hexo themes are independent projects, with separate <code>_config.yml</code> files.</p><p>Instead of forking a theme, and maintaining a custom version with your settings, you can configure it from somewhere else:</p><p><strong>from <code>theme_config</code> in site’s primary configuration file</strong></p><blockquote><p>Supported since Hexo 2.8.2</p></blockquote><pre><code class="yml"># _config.ymltheme: "my-theme"theme_config:  bio: "My awesome bio"  foo:    bar: 'a'</code></pre><pre><code class="yml"># themes/my-theme/_config.ymlbio: "Some generic bio"logo: "a-cool-image.png"  foo:    baz: 'b'</code></pre><p>Resulting in theme configuration:</p><pre><code class="json">{  bio: "My awesome bio",  logo: "a-cool-image.png",  foo: {    bar: "a",    baz: "b"  }}</code></pre><p><strong>from a dedicated <code>_config.[theme].yml</code> file</strong></p><blockquote><p>Supported since Hexo 5.0.0</p></blockquote><p>The file should be placed in your site folder, both <code>yml</code> and <code>json</code> are supported. <code>theme</code> inside <code>_config.yml</code> must be configured for Hexo to read <code>_config.[theme].yml</code></p><pre><code class="yml"># _config.ymltheme: "my-theme"</code></pre><pre><code class="yml"># _config.my-theme.ymlbio: "My awesome bio"foo:  bar: 'a'</code></pre><pre><code class="yml"># themes/my-theme/_config.ymlbio: "Some generic bio"logo: "a-cool-image.png"  foo:    baz: 'b'</code></pre><p>Resulting in theme configuration:</p><pre><code class="json">{  bio: "My awesome bio",  logo: "a-cool-image.png",  foo: {    bar: "a",    baz: "b"  }}</code></pre><p>We strongly recommend you to store your theme configuration in one place.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You can use internationalization to present your site in different languages. The default language is set by modifying the <code>language</code> setting in <code>_config.yml</code>. You can also set multiple languages and modify the order of default languages.</p><pre><code class="yaml">language: zh-twlanguage:- zh-tw- en</code></pre><h3 id="Language-Files"><a href="#Language-Files" class="headerlink" title="Language Files"></a>Language Files</h3><p>Language files can be YAML or JSON files. You should put them into the <code>languages</code> folder in the theme. There is support for the <a href="https://github.com/alexei/sprintf.js">printf format</a> in language files.</p><h3 id="Templates"><a href="#Templates" class="headerlink" title="Templates"></a>Templates</h3><p>Use <code>__</code> or <code>_p</code> helpers in templates to get the translated strings. The former is for normal usage and the latter is for plural strings. For example:</p><pre><code class="yaml">index:  title: Home  add: Add  video:    zero: No videos    one: One video    other: %d videos</code></pre><pre><code class="js">&lt;%= __('index.title') %&gt;// Home&lt;%= _p('index.video', 3) %&gt;// 3 videos</code></pre><h3 id="Path"><a href="#Path" class="headerlink" title="Path"></a>Path</h3><p>You can set the language of pages in front-matter, or modify the <code>i18n_dir</code> setting in <code>_config.yml</code> to enable automatic detection by Hexo.</p><pre><code class="yaml">i18n_dir: :lang</code></pre><p>The default value of <code>i18n_dir</code> setting is <code>:lang</code>, which means that Hexo will detect the language within the first segment of URL. For example:</p><pre><code class="plain">/index.html =&gt; en/archives/index.html =&gt; en/zh-tw/index.html =&gt; zh-tw</code></pre><p>The string will only be served as a language when the language file exists. So <code>archives</code> in <code>/archives/index.html</code> (example 2) will not get served as a language.</p>]]></content>

      <url>/2021/11/02/plugins/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hexo has a powerful plugin system, which makes it easy to extend functions without modifying the source code of the core module. There are two kinds of plugins in Hexo:</p><h3 id="Script"><a href="#Script" class="headerlink" title="Script"></a>Script</h3><p>If your plugin is relatively simple, it’s recommended to use a script. All you need to do is put your JavaScript files in the <code>scripts</code> folder and Hexo will load them during initialization.</p><h3 id="Plugin"><a href="#Plugin" class="headerlink" title="Plugin"></a>Plugin</h3><p>If your code is complicated or if you want to publish it to the NPM registry, we recommend using a plugin. First, create a folder in the <code>node_modules</code> folder. The name of this folder must begin with <code>hexo-</code> or Hexo will ignore it.</p><p>Your new folder must contain at least two files: one containing the actual JavaScript code and one <code>package.json</code> file that describes the purpose of the plugin and sets its dependencies.</p><pre><code class="plain">.├── index.js└── package.json</code></pre><p>At the very least, you should set the <code>name</code>, <code>version</code> and <code>main</code> entries in <code>package.json</code>. For example:</p><pre><code class="json">{  "name": "hexo-my-plugin",  "version": "0.0.1",  "main": "index"}</code></pre><p>You’ll also need to list your plugin as a dependency in the root <code>package.json</code> of your hexo instance in order for Hexo to detect and load it.</p><h3 id="Tools"><a href="#Tools" class="headerlink" title="Tools"></a>Tools</h3><p>You can make use of the official tools provided by Hexo to accelerate development:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-fs">hexo-fs</a>：File IO</li><li><a href="https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-util">hexo-util</a>：Utilities</li><li><a href="https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-i18n">hexo-i18n</a>：Localization (i18n)</li><li><a href="https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-pagination">hexo-pagination</a>：Generate pagination data</li></ul><h3 id="Publishing"><a href="#Publishing" class="headerlink" title="Publishing"></a>Publishing</h3><p>When your plugin is ready, you may consider publishing it to the <a href="/plugins">plugin list</a> to invite other people to start using it. Publishing your own plugins is very similar to <a href="contributing.html#Updating_Documentation">updating documentation</a>.</p><ol><li><p>Fork <a href="https://github.com/hexojs/site">hexojs/site</a></p></li><li><p>Clone the repository to your computer and install dependencies.</p> <pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/&lt;username&gt;/site.git$ cd site$ npm install</code></pre></li><li><p>Edit <code>source/_data/plugins.yml</code> and add your plugin. For example:</p> <pre><code>- name: hexo-server  description: Server module for Hexo.  link: https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-server  tags:    - official    - server    - console</code></pre></li><li><p>Push the branch.</p></li><li><p>Create a pull request and describe the change.</p></li></ol>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hexo has two built-in syntax highlight libraries, <a href="https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js">highlight.js</a> and <a href="https://github.com/PrismJS/prism">prismjs</a>.

Check out <a href="tag-plugins#Code-Block">Tag Plugin Docs</a> to find out options available.</p><blockquote><p>Tip: Hexo support posts written in any format, so long the corresponding renderer plugin is installed. It can be in markdown, ejs, swig, nunjucks, pug, asciidoc, etc. Regardless of the format used, those three code block syntax will always be available.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Configuration"><a href="#Configuration" class="headerlink" title="Configuration"></a>Configuration</h2><pre><code class="yaml"># _config.ymlhighlight:  enable: true  auto_detect: false  line_number: true  tab_replace: ''  wrap: true  hljs: falseprismjs:  enable: false  preprocess: true  line_number: true  tab_replace: ''</code></pre><p>The YAML above is Hexo’s default configuration.</p><h2 id="Disabled"><a href="#Disabled" class="headerlink" title="Disabled"></a>Disabled</h2><pre><code class="yaml"># _config.ymlhighlight:  enable: falseprismjs:  enable: false</code></pre><p>When both <code>highlight.enable</code> and <code>prismjs.enable</code> are <code>false</code>, the output HTML of the code block is controlled by the corresponding renderer. For example, <a href="https://github.com/markedjs/marked"><code>marked.js</code></a> (used by <a href="https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-renderer-marked"><code>hexo-renderer-marked</code></a>, the default markdown renderer of Hexo) will add the language code to the <code>class</code> of <code>&lt;code&gt;</code>:</p><pre><code class="markdown">```yamlhello: hexo```</code></pre><pre><code class="html">&lt;pre&gt;  &lt;code class="yaml"&gt;hello: hexo&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</code></pre><p>When no built-in syntax highlight is enabled, you can either install third-party syntax-highlight plugin, or use a browser-side syntax hilighter (e.g. <code>highlight.js</code> and <code>prism.js</code> both support running in browser).</p><h2 id="Highlight-js"><a href="#Highlight-js" class="headerlink" title="Highlight.js"></a>Highlight.js</h2><pre><code class="yaml"># _config.ymlhighlight:  enable: true  auto_detect: false  line_number: true  tab_replace: '  '  wrap: true  hljs: falseprismjs:  enable: false</code></pre><p><code>highlight.js</code> is enabled by default and used as server-side highlighting in Hexo; it needs to be disabled if you prefer to run <code>highlight.js</code> on browser-side.</p><blockquote><p>Server-side means, the syntax highlight is generated during <code>hexo generate</code> or <code>hexo server</code>.</p></blockquote><h3 id="auto-detect"><a href="#auto-detect" class="headerlink" title="auto_detect"></a>auto_detect</h3><p><code>auto_detect</code> is a <code>highlight.js</code> feature that detect language of the code block automatically.</p><blockquote><p>Tip: When you want to use “sublanguage highlight”, enable <code>auto_detect</code> and don’t mark language when writing code block.</p></blockquote><p><code>auto_detect</code> is very resource-intensive.

      <url>/2021/11/02/templates/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Templates define the presentation of your website by describing what each page should look like. The table below shows the corresponding template for every available page. At the very least, a theme should contain an <code>index</code> template.</p><div class="video-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mb65bQ4iUc4" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><table><thead><tr><th>Template</th><th>Page</th><th>Fallback</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>index</code></td><td>Home page</td><td></td></tr><tr><td><code>post</code></td><td>Posts</td><td><code>index</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>page</code></td><td>Pages</td><td><code>index</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>archive</code></td><td>Archives</td><td><code>index</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>category</code></td><td>Category archives</td><td><code>archive</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>tag</code></td><td>Tag archives</td><td><code>archive</code></td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="Layouts"><a href="#Layouts" class="headerlink" title="Layouts"></a>Layouts</h2><p>When pages share a similar structure - for instance, when two templates have both a header and a footer - you can consider using a <code>layout</code> to declare these structural similarities. Every layout file should contain a <code>body</code> variable to display the contents of the template in question. For example:</p><pre><code class="html">index</code></pre><pre><code class="html">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;&lt;html&gt;  &lt;body&gt;&lt;%- body %&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre><p>yields:</p><pre><code class="html">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;&lt;html&gt;  &lt;body&gt;index&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre><p>By default, the <code>layout</code> template is used by all other templates. You can specify additional layouts in the front-matter or set it to <code>false</code> to disable it. It’s even possible to build a complex nested structure by including more layout templates in your top layout.</p><h2 id="Partials"><a href="#Partials" class="headerlink" title="Partials"></a>Partials</h2><p>Partials are useful for sharing components between your templates. Typical examples include headers, footers or sidebars. You may want to put your partials in separate files to make maintaining your website significantly more convenient. For example:</p><pre><code class="html">&lt;h1 id="logo"&gt;&lt;%= config.title %&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;</code></pre><pre><code class="html">&lt;%- partial('partial/header') %&gt;&lt;div id="content"&gt;Home page&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre><p>yields:</p><pre><code class="html">&lt;h1 id="logo"&gt;My Site&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;div id="content"&gt;Home page&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre><h2 id="Local-Variables"><a href="#Local-Variables" class="headerlink" title="Local Variables"></a>Local Variables</h2><p>You can define local variables in templates and use them in other templates.</p><pre><code class="html">&lt;h1 id="logo"&gt;&lt;%= title %&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;</code></pre><pre><code class="html">&lt;%- partial('partial/header', {title: 'Hello World'}) %&gt;&lt;div id="content"&gt;Home page&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre><p>yields:</p><pre><code class="html">&lt;h1 id="logo"&gt;Hello World&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;div id="content"&gt;Home page&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre><h2 id="Optimization"><a href="#Optimization" class="headerlink" title="Optimization"></a>Optimization</h2><p>If your theme is exceedingly complex or if the number of files to generate becomes too large, Hexo’s file generation performance may begin to decrease considerably. Aside from simplifying your theme, you may also try Fragment Caching, which was introduced in Hexo 2.7.</p><p>This feature was borrowed from <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/caching_with_rails.html#fragment-caching">Ruby on Rails</a>. It causes content to be saved as fragments and cached for when additional requests are made. This can reduce the number of database queries and can also speed up file generation.</p><p>Fragment caching is best used for headers, footers, sidebars or other static content that is unlikely to change from template to template. For example:</p><pre><code class="js">&lt;%- fragment_cache('header', function(){  return '&lt;header&gt;&lt;/header&gt;';});</code></pre><p>Though it may be easier to use partials:</p><pre><code class="js">&lt;%- partial('header', {}, {cache: true});</code></pre><p><code>fragment_cache()</code> will cache the rendered result and output the cached result to other pages. This should only be used on partials that are expected <strong>not</strong> to change across different pages. Otherwise, it should <strong>not</strong> be enabled.<br>For example, it should be disabled when <code>relative_link</code> is enabled in the config. This is because relative links may appear differently across pages.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="video-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5ROIU_9dYe4" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>It’s easy to build a Hexo theme - you just have to create a new folder. To start using your theme, modify the <code>theme</code> setting in your site’s <code>_config.yml</code>. A theme should have the following structure:</p><pre><code class="plain">.├── _config.yml├── languages├── layout├── scripts└── source</code></pre><h3 id="config-yml"><a href="#config-yml" class="headerlink" title="_config.yml"></a>_config.yml</h3><p>Theme configuration file. Unlike the site’s primary configuration file, modifying this doesn’t require a server restart.</p><h3 id="languages"><a href="#languages" class="headerlink" title="languages"></a>languages</h3><p>Language folder. See <a href="internationalization.html">internationalization (i18n)</a> for more info.</p><h3 id="layout"><a href="#layout" class="headerlink" title="layout"></a>layout</h3><p>Layout folder. This folder contains the theme’s template files, which define the appearance of your website. Hexo provides the <a href="https://github.com/node-swig/swig-templates">Swig</a> template engine by default, but you can easily install additional plugins to support alternative engines such as <a href="https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-renderer-ejs">EJS</a>, <a href="https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-renderer-haml">Haml</a>, <a href="https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-renderer-jade">Jade</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/maxknee/hexo-render-pug">Pug</a>. Hexo chooses the template engine based on the file extension of the template (just like the posts). For example:</p><pre><code class="plain">layout.ejs   - uses EJSlayout.swig  - uses Swig</code></pre><p>See <a href="templates.html">templates</a> for more info.</p><h3 id="scripts"><a href="#scripts" class="headerlink" title="scripts"></a>scripts</h3><p>Script folder. Hexo will automatically load all JavaScript files in this folder during initialization. For more info, see <a href="plugins.html">plugins</a>.</p><h3 id="source"><a href="#source" class="headerlink" title="source"></a>source</h3><p>Source folder. Place your assets (e.g. CSS and JavaScript files) here. Hexo ignores hidden files and files or folders prefixed with <code>_</code> (underscore).</p><p>Hexo will process and save all renderable files to the <code>public</code> folder. Non-renderable files will be copied to the <code>public</code> folder directly.</p><h3 id="Publishing"><a href="#Publishing" class="headerlink" title="Publishing"></a>Publishing</h3><p>When you have finished building your theme, you can publish it to the <a href="/themes">theme list</a>. Before doing so, you should run the <a href="https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-theme-unit-test">theme unit test</a> to ensure that everything works. The steps for publishing a theme are very similar to those for <a href="contributing.html#Updating_Documentation">updating documentation</a>.</p><ol><li><p>Fork <a href="https://github.com/hexojs/site">hexojs/site</a></p></li><li><p>Clone the repository to your computer and install dependencies.</p><pre><code class="shell">$ git clone https://github.com/&lt;username&gt;/site.git$ cd site$ npm install</code></pre></li><li><p>Edit <code>source/_data/themes.yml</code> and add your theme. For example:</p><pre><code class="yaml">- name: landscape  description: A brand new default theme for Hexo.  link: https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-theme-landscape  preview: http://hexo.io/hexo-theme-landscape  tags:    - official    - responsive    - widget    - two_column    - one_column</code></pre></li><li><p>Add a screenshot (with the same name as the theme) to <code>source/themes/screenshots</code>. It must be a 800*500px PNG.</p></li><li><p>Push the branch.</p></li><li><p>Create a pull request and describe the change.</p></li></ol>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="video-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AIqBubK6ZLc" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>To create a new post or a new page, you can run the following command:</p><pre><code class="bash">$ hexo new [layout] &lt;title&gt;</code></pre><p><code>post</code> is the default <code>layout</code>, but you can supply your own. You can change the default layout by editing the <code>default_layout</code> setting in <code>_config.yml</code>.</p><h3 id="Layout"><a href="#Layout" class="headerlink" title="Layout"></a>Layout</h3><p>There are three default layouts in Hexo: <code>post</code>, <code>page</code> and <code>draft</code>. Files created by each of them is saved to a different path. Newly created posts are saved to the <code>source/_posts</code> folder.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Layout</th><th>Path</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>post</code></td><td><code>source/_posts</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>page</code></td><td><code>source</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>draft</code></td><td><code>source/_drafts</code></td></tr></tbody></table><p>If you don’t want an article (post/page) to be processed with a theme, set <code>layout: false</code> in its front-matter. Refer to <a href="/docs/front-matter#Layout">this section</a> for more details.</p><h3 id="Filename"><a href="#Filename" class="headerlink" title="Filename"></a>Filename</h3><p>By default, Hexo uses the post title as its filename. You can edit the <code>new_post_name</code> setting in <code>_config.yml</code> to change the default filename. For example, <code>:year-:month-:day-:title.md</code> will prefix filenames with the post creation date. You can use the following placeholders:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Placeholder</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>:title</code></td><td>Post title (lower case, with spaces replaced by hyphens)</td></tr><tr><td><code>:year</code></td><td>Created year, e.g. <code>2015</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>:month</code></td><td>Created month (leading zeros), e.g. <code>04</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>:i_month</code></td><td>Created month (no leading zeros), e.g. <code>4</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>:day</code></td><td>Created day (leading zeros), e.g. <code>07</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>:i_day</code></td><td>Created day (no leading zeros), e.g. <code>7</code></td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="Drafts"><a href="#Drafts" class="headerlink" title="Drafts"></a>Drafts</h3><p>Previously, we mentioned a special layout in Hexo: <code>draft</code>. Posts initialized with this layout are saved to the <code>source/_drafts</code> folder. You can use the <code>publish</code> command to move drafts to the <code>source/_posts</code> folder. <code>publish</code> works in a similar way to the <code>new</code> command.</p><pre><code class="bash">$ hexo publish [layout] &lt;title&gt;</code></pre><p>Drafts are not displayed by default. You can add the <code>--draft</code> option when running Hexo or enable the <code>render_drafts</code> setting in <code>_config.yml</code> to render drafts.</p><h3 id="Scaffolds"><a href="#Scaffolds" class="headerlink" title="Scaffolds"></a>Scaffolds</h3><p>When creating posts, Hexo will build files based on the corresponding file in <code>scaffolds</code> folder. For example:</p><pre><code class="bash">$ hexo new photo "My Gallery"</code></pre><p>When you run this command, Hexo will try to find <code>photo.md</code> in the <code>scaffolds</code> folder and build the post based on it. The following placeholders are available in scaffolds:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Placeholder</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>layout</code></td><td>Layout</td></tr><tr><td><code>title</code></td><td>Title</td></tr><tr><td><code>date</code></td><td>File created date</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="Supported-Formats"><a href="#Supported-Formats" class="headerlink" title="Supported Formats"></a>Supported Formats</h3><p>Hexo support posts written in any format, as long as the corresponding renderer plugin is installed.</p><p>For example, Hexo has <code>hexo-renderer-marked</code> and <code>hexo-renderer-ejs</code> installed by default, so you can write your posts in <code>markdown</code> or in <code>ejs</code>. If you have <code>hexo-renderer-pug</code> installed, then you can even write your post in pug template language.</p><p>You can rename your posts and change to file extension from <code>.md</code> to <code>.ejs</code>, then Hexo will use <code>hexo-renderer-ejs</code> to render that file, so do the other formats.</p>]]></content>
